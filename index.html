        <p class="bio">
          I am a Rising Senior at Lynbrook High School and an aspiring pharmaceutical scientist. I am currently a Pharmacy Assistant at Savco Pharmacy 
          and I am taking a General Chemistry class at West Valley College to further pursue my passion for the sciences. 
          I love spending time with my family and friends, and I also seek ways to give back to the larger community that I am part of. 
          I have led and participated in a multitude of iniatives designed to spread STEM knowledge to the youth such as volunteering at the
          Tech Interactive, serving as Education Development Coordinator at Little Champs, being the Marketing Head for Supernova Hacks, 
          being the San Jose Chapter Head of STEM4kids, and cofounding BioGenius. As an aspiring pharmacist and as a peek into what I want to spend the rest of my life
          doing, I am passionately researching the negative effects of Antidepressants on pregnant women under my mentor Maria Brouard. 
          Like my involvement in my school's 
          National Honor Society, Women in STEM, JV Tennis Team (Captain), 
          and EPIC Student Journalism (Business Manager), I plan to deeply engage within the scientific and personal communities I become a part of in my future college and career, 
          along with honing the relationships I have already made.
